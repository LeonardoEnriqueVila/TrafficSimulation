# Traffic Simulation

This project is a basic traffic simulation where multiple cars interact at an intersection, respond to traffic lights, and move in different directions, including turning. The project uses Python and the Pygame library to create the simulation environment.

## Description

The Traffic Simulation project models a simple intersection with traffic lights and cars. Cars move through the intersection, obey traffic lights, and can turn in different directions. The simulation aims to demonstrate basic traffic dynamics and the impact of traffic lights on vehicle movement.

## Features

- Multiple cars moving through an intersection
- Traffic lights controlling vehicle flow
- Cars can turn left, right, or go straight
- Randomized car behavior and spawning

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For the core logic of the simulation
- **Pygame**: For rendering the graphics and handling user input
- **Random**: To simulate randomized car behaviors and spawning
- **Sys**: For system-specific parameters and functions

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LeonardoEnriqueVila/TrafficSimulation
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd traffic-simulation
    ```
3. Install the required modules:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

## Usage

To start the simulation, run the following command:
```bash
python Screen.py
